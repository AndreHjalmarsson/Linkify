# Linkify

A humble Reddit copy


## Installation
1. Clone this repo to either github desktop or ZIP.

2. Create a new database called "linkify". Import the database file linkify.sql (located in the root of the project) to your new database.

3. If running this project on a Mac computer you might have to change the databse settings in order for it to work. This is done in the file conn.php located at resources/lib/conn.php. On line 4 in that file you should add ":8889" to the "localhost" string. After this is done it should display: "localhost:8889".

4. When the steps above are completed you should be able to run the project successfully!
